Hey curious reader, 

Currently, we're at the very beginning stage still trying to sort out problems that we can address one step at a  time. If you're interested and feel like doing something with us, why  not join the quest?

If you find this an interesting problem to  solve, and would like to learn more about the efforts and concepts that  the world is taking on, start reading about [Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) or checkout the video below.
